# The Reason Why I Use This Platform

**Github** is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus **access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis** for every project. 

In my idea, I think GitHub can share some useful information for computer engineers, software developers, and mnay persons who want to get some ideas for making their own programs, applications, codes, and many useful resources to adapt for their own projects.

In addition, this service let people can follow my activities for the changes of the blog or repository which is called "Commits". They will show all activities of changing the information all the times when the users use my own repository. Also, they can put the star on their account as "following" my repository movement.

It has a little disadvantage, The font size and font color cannot be changed or adjusted. However, it can be **bold** and _Italic_ to make the information clear for the readers.

You can do a lot of things with git, and many of the rules of what you **should** 
do are not so much technical limitations 
but are about what works well when working together with other people. 
So git is a very powerful set of tools. - Linus Torvalds
